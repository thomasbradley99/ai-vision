CLIP: 320s - 410s
======================================================================

00:00-00:08: The clip begins with DARK GI in a top position over WHITE GI, who is on his back. DARK GI is actively attempting to pass WHITE GI's guard, specifically working to clear WHITE GI's legs from what appears to be a half-guard or open-guard engagement. WHITE GI is diligently defending, using his legs to maintain distance and prevent DARK GI from achieving a dominant passing position like side control. Both athletes are constantly shifting and adjusting their grips and weight.
00:08-00:18: DARK GI continues to press the guard pass, moving around WHITE GI's legs, while WHITE GI continues to use his guard to prevent the pass. The grappling sequence is ongoing when the video begins to fade to black. There are no submission attempts, sweeps, or position changes that lead to a yield and a subsequent reset (stand up and fist bump) during this clip for DARK GI and WHITE GI. The video ends with them still actively engaged in the guard passing sequence.
