The Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu training session unfolds on a blue mat, involving two primary athletes: DARK GI (wearing a dark gi and white belt) and WHITE GI (wearing a light gi and purple belt). Other practitioners are visible in the background, engaged in their own training.

0:00-0:03: WHITE GI, lying on his back, pulls DARK GI into a closed guard position from standing.
0:03-0:05: DARK GI postures up to disengage from the closed guard. He then kneels to re-engage with WHITE GI, who is now maintaining an open guard.
0:05-0:12: DARK GI attempts to pass WHITE GI's open guard, controlling the legs and gi. WHITE GI actively maintains open guard, working grips to set up potential sweeps or submissions.
0:12-0:16: WHITE GI transitions from the open guard into an armbar attempt on DARK GI's right arm, successfully locking in the submission.
0:16-0:20: DARK GI yields to the armbar, tapping out. WHITE GI releases the hold, but both athletes remain engaged on the mat, continuing the roll without performing a full reset ritual (standing up, fist bump).
0:20-0:26: WHITE GI gains a dominant top position, establishing what appears to be a knee-on-belly or side control over DARK GI. He works to stabilize the position, while DARK GI defends and tries to escape.
0:26-0:30: From his back, DARK GI attempts a sweep against WHITE GI's top control. WHITE GI defends the sweep effectively and maintains his dominant position, transitioning into a different guard passing attempt.
0:30-0:38: WHITE GI continues to work for a guard pass, controlling DARK GI's hips and legs. DARK GI maintains a strong defensive posture, attempting to recover his guard.
0:38-0:42: DARK GI attempts another sweep, inverting and using his legs to try and off-balance WHITE GI. WHITE GI successfully defends the sweep and then disengages from the roll, moving to a kneeling position.
0:42-0:51: Both athletes slowly return to kneeling positions and adjust their gis, preparing for the next round.
0:51-0:52: They exchange a fist bump, indicating a **RESET**. This reset follows WHITE GI's successful defense of DARK GI's sweep attempt at 0:38-0:42, which concluded the previous engagement.

0:52-0:55: From kneeling positions, WHITE GI (sitting) and DARK GI (kneeling) begin a new round, grasping hands.
0:55-1:01: DARK GI immediately initiates a guard pull, bringing WHITE GI into an open guard position. WHITE GI promptly begins working on a guard pass.
1:01-1:06: WHITE GI attempts to pass DARK GI's open guard, controlling his legs and posture. DARK GI maintains open guard, looking for opportunities for sweeps or submissions.
1:06-1:09: WHITE GI continues his guard passing efforts, focusing on controlling DARK GI's lower body.
1:09-1:12: WHITE GI successfully passes DARK GI's open guard and establishes side control, with DARK GI flat on his back.
1:12-1:15: WHITE GI releases the side control position and sits up. DARK GI rolls to his side and also sits up. There is no fist bump or full reset ritual, so the successful guard pass is treated as part of the continuous drilling.
1:15-1:24: Both athletes remain seated, conversing and resting briefly.
1:24-1:25: They prepare to re-engage, grasping hands to signal the start of another exchange.
1:25-1:29: DARK GI immediately pulls guard again, establishing an open guard.
1:29-1:31: WHITE GI begins to work on passing DARK GI's open guard once more.
